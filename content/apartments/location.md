The coastal city of Bradenton, Florida resides on the banks of the Manatee River just 45 miles south
of Tampa and 25 miles south of St. Petersburg, crossing over the iconic Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Bradenton
is home to the Bradenton Marauders at LECOM Park where residents and tourists alike gather for baseball
games and events. The South Florida Museum is a huge hit with families complete with a planetarium,
aquarium, and history museum. If you’re looking for restored historical buildings, be sure to visit the
Manatee Village Historical Park, where you’ll find artifacts on pioneer life in Florida.

Residents enjoy browsing the Red Barn Flea Market, as well golfing at River Run Golf Links or Pinebrook
Ironwood Golf Course. Community parks are abundant, and the city even has a dog park, Happy Tails Dog Park,
at G.T. Bray Park. Visit the Riverwalk for open green space, a community amphitheater, kid-friendly splash
park, and picturesque views of Manatee River. Enjoy a cold craft brew at Motorworks Brewing, Bradenton’s
first craft brewery. Find your ideal apartment at Citrus Meadows Apartments and begin enjoying its scenic
views and plentiful amenities!
